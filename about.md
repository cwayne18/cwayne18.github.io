Welcome to my personal site.  My name is Chris Wayne and I am an Engineering Manager and an Author (technically, self-published).  I'll speak here about technical topics, as well as telling the story of my weight loss.  Having lost 170 pounds since 2012, I like to share my story in the hopes that it might help someone, anyone, lose weight themselves.   I even wrote a book about it!  The book is currently available at Amazon, [here](https://amazon.com/dp/B08T8HPCKC).
